Image README Prompt for GitHub

Objective: Create/improve/expand the README from images in this folder.

Do this:
- Examine IMAGES ONLY in the current directory.
- Create a new README.md (if none exists) or edit/improve the existing one.
- Structure the README with sections in this exact order:
- Brief overview of the images (1–2 sentences summarizing folder contents)
- Importance and Business use cases (bullet list of key benefits and scenarios)
- List of all images in the folder with explanations of their purpose (use relative links)
- Include the images in the README file itself where appropriate
- Table of contents with anchor links to sections and relative links to files
- Statement that these were actual examples used in company communications
- Use proper README Markdown syntax:
- Use heading levels consistently (#, ##, ###)
- Apply bold, italic, blockquotes, and lists appropriately
- Use code blocks for examples or snippets
- Use GitHub anchor format for links (lowercase, spaces → hyphens, remove punctuation)
- Use relative links for files (e.g., ./filename.ext)
- Create section anchors and links:
- Link each TOC entry to its corresponding section heading
- Link all listed files to their actual paths in the folder
- Ensure all links are relative and functional
- Include metadata:
- Add "Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD" at the end
- Do NOT include PII, proprietary info, or sensitive company details.
- Generalize examples where necessary.

Do NOT do this:
- Include any information regarding files that are NOT images (.jpeg, .png, .jpg)
- Include links to the image files themselves; they will be deleted later
- Use absolute links (e.g., full URLs) instead of relative paths.
- Create broken or non-functional anchor links.
- Leave sections empty or incomplete.
- Include external images without alt text.
