Meeting overview, meeting do's and do' NOTS

Depending on the circumstances, a meeting may or may not be needed…

Is a synchronous decision or real‑time alignment required right now? Is this critical?
Yes → meeting.
No → async.
Do 3+ people need to contribute simultaneously (debate, brainstorm, unblock)?
Yes → meeting.
No → async.
Is the topic sensitive, complex, or likely to cause confusion without tone/body language?
Yes → meeting.
No → async.

Simple checklist to determine if meeting is needed:

Do meeting if
-	Requires fast decision with critical deadline
-	brainstorming, whiteboarding or Co design that benefits from screen sharing
-	resolve conflicts have performance conversations or sensitive topics which need proper tone
-	onboarding, UAT testing or debugging where screen share is a necessity
-	Kanban call, planning sessions, sharing with stakeholders, looking at roadmaps
-	Social time, Team cohesion
-	If message depth goes longer than 6 to 8 back and forth messages, or involves multiple questions
-	Not getting response via email/chat

do not do meeting if:
-	quick status updates, progress reports or read only announcements
-	quick factual questions (dates, links, clarifications, resources, schedules)
-	involves only one person

-	title/subject: desired outcome
-	agenda: 3+ bullets
-	pre-read links, what to review before call
-	Output expected, contingency, mention follow ups
