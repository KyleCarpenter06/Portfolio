Power Query Steps:
	- source sql query to merge tables from Azure SQL
	- Language lowercase: convert language to lowercase to match case exactly
	- Add Lang 11: Adds new column to show their preferred language based on 11 language SOP
	- Add Lang 24: Adds new column to show their preferred language based on 24 language SOP
	- Reorder Lang: Places language columns closer to left side of the sheet
	- Remove Lang: removes unwanted lowercase language from the final sheet
	- Convert WWID to Numbers: converts text to number for easier searching of this column
	- Full null region values: Adds new region column, defaults to ASPAC if user is found but no region, else UNKNOWN
	- Full null country values: Adds new country column, defaults to UNKNOWN if country not listed or user is not found
	- Remove region and country: removes these two columns so only one of each exists
	- Rename region and country: renames "Region2" and "Country2" to "region" and "country" for simplicity
	- Full null Manager WWID, Email, Full Name: Looks for null values and converts to "unknown" if possible
	- Reorder: reorders all columns
