Code Cleaning Prompt for GitHub

Objective: Polish the code in this file.

Do this:
- Create comments to explain code lines:
	- Place comments above lines that are important (e.g., introducing new sections, conditionals, loops).
	- For less critical lines, place comments to the right of the code.
	- If multiple variables are declared consecutively, use one comment above all vars explaining their collective purpose.
- Avoid large line spacing between code lines.
- Safeguard personal identifiable information (PII):
	- Replace personal names, company names, project names, email addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth with generic placeholders.
	- Example: "John Smith" → "Employee Name"; "Johnson and Johnson Inc." → "Company Name Services, Inc."
	- Maintain original casing and formatting conventions.
- Safeguard URLs that reference actual companies:
	- Replace with generic or placeholder URLs.
	- Example: "https://ap.companyname.com/" → "https://ap.example.com/"
- Safeguard company images and logos:
	- Replace with generic placeholder images using embedded SVG data URIs.
	- Preserve original image dimensions and aspect ratios.
	- Match hex foreground and background colors from the original image.
	- Example: Replace "Johnson and Johnson Logo" with a generic "Company Name" text placeholder in matching colors.
- Place a comment block at the top explaining:
	- Purpose of the code
	- Usage instructions
	- Key variables and their roles
- Maintain proper indentation and tab structure:
	- Conditional blocks (if/then/else) should use consistent indentation.
	- HTML tables should use nested indentation for clarity.
	- Example:
		if (condition)
			// action here
		else
			// alternate action here
- Fix any syntax errors or potential logic errors discovered.
- For non-English content, use HTML entity encoding compatible with email service providers (e.g., &ecirc;, &ntilde;, &ccedil;).

Do NOT do this:
- Translate non-English text into English.
	- If non-English text contains PII, replace only the PII with generic placeholders while preserving the original language.
- Include anything that could reveal proprietary information, trade secrets, or confidential business logic.
- Remove or obscure code functionality; only safeguard sensitive identifiers and references.
