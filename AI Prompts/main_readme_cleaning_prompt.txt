Main README Prompt for GitHub

Objective: Create or improve and expand the main README in this folder.

Do this:
	- Examine all subfolders in main directory.
	- Create a new README.md (if none exists) or edit/improve the existing one.
	- Edit only the lines below my name, email and linkedIn
	- Structure the README with sections in this exact order:
		- Brief overview of what to expect in the folders
		- Table of contents of each folder
			- Must be in alphabetical order
			- Must match folder name exactly
			- Each table of contents item links to item below
		- Short explanation of each folders
			- Each must have a link to the readme (if exists)
			- If there is no readme in the folder, link to the folder itself
	- Use proper README Markdown syntax:
		- Use heading levels consistently (#, ##, ###)
		- Apply bold, italic, blockquotes, and lists appropriately
		- Use code blocks for examples or snippets
		- Use GitHub anchor format for links (lowercase, spaces → hyphens, remove punctuation)
		- Use relative links for files (e.g., ./filename.ext)
	- Create section anchors and links:
		- Link each TOC entry to its corresponding section heading
		- Link all listed files to their actual paths in the folder
		- Ensure all links are relative and functional
	- Include metadata:
		- Add "Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD" at the end

Do NOT do this:
	- Edit the top biography or personal contact information
	- Omit any files or folders present in the directory.
	- Use absolute links (e.g., full URLs) instead of relative paths.
	- Create broken or non-functional anchor links.
	- Leave sections empty or incomplete.
	- Include external images without alt text.
