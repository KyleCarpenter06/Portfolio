UAT vs. PROD
	- UAT = validate functionality, business logic, and data flows with realistic/non-production data and real user scenarios before external sharing
	- PROD testing = validate the live system under production constraints, monitoring performance and ensure safe public access
	- endpoints differ between UAT and PROD
	- need to keep data sets separate
	- different postman environments between the two
	- test data is only send through UAT
	
UAT process
	- Confirm business requirements are met, data is in correct format for distribution
	- Lets internal stakeholders validate data transformation, field mappings, and edge/bulk cases
	- Uses safe, scrubbed, or synthetic data so you can exercise real scenarios without leaking PII
	
PROD process
	- Verifies the live integration with real, full-volume data and production auth flows
	- Full performance/load tests & capacity checks, hypercare
	- Protects data integrity and compliance when sharing with outside teams
