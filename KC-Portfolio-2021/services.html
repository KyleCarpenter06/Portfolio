Well look no further as I have knowledge just about every aspect of the development process from the initial sketches all the way to the final product.

                                Over the years, I've become more accustomed to understand what makes a great illustration and what ideas and tools are used to help keep the creative juices flowing. I can create and develop a wide variety of illustrations on many different mediums. In terms of traditional art, I can create art using acrylic paint, markers, colored pencils, micron pens or simply pencil. In terms of digital art, I can use my wacom tablet to make raster or vector art.

In my professional career, I have been editing videos for a sports live streaming company for over three years now working with many different notable clients. In edition to simple video editing, I also have basic knowledge of camera software and equipment and can perform basic video tasks such as chroma keying, color filtering and simple motion graphics.

                                Audio editing has been a hobby of mine as well for some time as I editing audio files for both my YouTube videos and editing songs for my personal playlist. Using programs such as Adobe Audition and Cubase, I can perform basic audio editing tasks such as audio splicing, reverberation, amplification, pitch shifting and equalizing as well as more advanced tasks such as noise cancellation, vocal removing and channel extracting.

                                Creating your own raster and vector art is certainly is a challenge but to take those designs and animate them is certainly a little bit harder. For recent projects, I was able to use a variety of programs to turn simple graphics into amazing moving images. GIF animations, when used the correct way, can truly transform your websites or social media platform or simply just wow your friends, all while keeping disk space low.

                                Is your computer booting up slowly? Does it take what seems like forever just to load simple images? Well I'm here to help. For years I've been fixing simple computer issues related to both hardware and software and I've learned a few tricks of the trade to get your computer running just like new. I'm sorry Apple users, I don't have much advice for you besides empty the trash and get a new machine.

                                Definitely not my strongest area of expertise, I certainly have a passion for creating 3D graphics and modeling. After years of playing online games, I wanted to try to make one for myself. While the project in the end was way too challenging, I still learned quite a lot and have some experience with both Blender and Unity which uses C#, a programming language which I'm familiar with.
