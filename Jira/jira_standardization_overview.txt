there are different project types in jira. Story, spike, bug, tasks, subtask and epic that the SFMC uses.

Stories are for communications (email, SMS, teams)
Sub tasks are checklist items done by the development team for communications, this also includes support tickets
spikes are to address technical issues and non-standard tasks such as hypercare
Tasks Are items that are attached to stories such as Validation of send as well as reporting, also used for support tickets
Bugs are used to address issues with QA testing for communications and other projects, bugs are linked to stories
