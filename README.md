# Hey there 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio!

I’m Kyle — a Senior Salesforce Marketing Cloud Email Developer & Automation Specialist who’s spent the last few years crafting business solutions and email marketing campaigns to make and keep everyone happy. I have worked at Fortune 500 companies and your local small business. I live for turning messy data + chaotic requests into smooth, scalable automations that make marketing teams smile and stakeholders do happy dances.

Open to chat, brainstorm, or geek out over segmentation logic — coffee’s on me (virtual or IRL)!  
Drop me a message here or on LinkedIn and let’s build something awesome together.
