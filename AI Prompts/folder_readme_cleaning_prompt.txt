Folder README Prompt for GitHub

Objective: Create or improve and expand the README in this folder.

Do this:
	- Examine all files and subfolders in the current directory.
	- Create a new README.md (if none exists) or edit/improve the existing one.
	- Structure the README with sections in this exact order:
		- Brief overview of files (1–2 sentences summarizing folder contents)
		- Importance and Business use cases (bullet list of key benefits and scenarios)
		- List of all files in the folder with explanations of their purpose (use relative links)
		- Table of contents with anchor links to sections and relative links to files
		- Statement that these were actual examples used in company communications
	- Use proper README Markdown syntax:
		- Use heading levels consistently (#, ##, ###)
		- Apply bold, italic, blockquotes, and lists appropriately
		- Use code blocks for examples or snippets
		- Use GitHub anchor format for links (lowercase, spaces → hyphens, remove punctuation)
		- Use relative links for files (e.g., ./filename.ext)
	- Create section anchors and links:
		- Link each TOC entry to its corresponding section heading
		- Link all listed files to their actual paths in the folder
		- Ensure all links are relative and functional
	- Include metadata:
		- Add "Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD" at the end
	- Do NOT include PII, proprietary info, or sensitive company details.
		- Generalize examples where necessary.

Do NOT do this:
	- Omit any files or folders present in the directory.
	- Use absolute links (e.g., full URLs) instead of relative paths.
	- Create broken or non-functional anchor links.
	- Leave sections empty or incomplete.
	- Include external images without alt text.
